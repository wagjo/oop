<div class="md-has-sidebar">
  <main>
    This project experiments with adding Tuftean sidenotes to Material for MkDocs.
    It's a bit simpler than what you'll find in the Tufte CSS and more like what
    Bureau Gorbunov projects use.
  </main>

  <aside>
    This is a margin note â€“ a sidenote without a footnote-style number.
    Footnotes aren't implemented yet, but would be nice to have, too.
